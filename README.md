# EC-VQE-for-polaron-calculations
This repository demonstrates an algorithm that constructs the lowest eigenvalue and eigenvector for particle-phonon systems in extended lattices combining Eigenvector Continuation (EC) and Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE).

This repository includes the codes used to generate the results presented in the manuscript  "Lattice stitching by eigenvector continuation for Holstein polaron". (E. Torabian, R. V. Krems, Lattice stitching by eigenvector continuation for Holstein polaron, *arXiv:2502.04500*, (2025).)
